# Specifics

Here are a few things you need to know if you'd like to use my code as a template for your own bot:

1. I have left out my token file so that other people can't modify my bot. You will need your own Token.py file where you assign your token to a variable named "key" because that's the variable that my bot.py script calls for.
2. Assuming Python and PIP is already installed on your system, you will need to use "pip install python-telegram-bot" in cmd to be able to run your bot file.
3. You will need a VM instance to be able to keep your bot running, otherwise you'll have to keep it running on your own system all the time. I used oracle cloud (https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/cloud/free/) because it comes with a free plan, which is enough for a telegram bot. You will need to make sure python 3.7 or above is installed on your VM. You will also need to use "pip install python-telegram-bot" again on your VM so that it has access to the required libraries.
